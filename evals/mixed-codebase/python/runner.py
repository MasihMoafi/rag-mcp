Finding 1 - repeated-trial runner.

What this adds to the original notebook:

  * a repetition loop with recorded seeds, so "n out of N" is a real rate and
    every trial is individually identified and auditable;

    On reproducibility, measured rather than assumed: with a fixed seed at
    temperature 1.0, an identical request issued back-to-back replays exactly,
    but the same request issued after intervening different requests does not.
    GPU inference is not bitwise deterministic across differing cache states,
    and this is not controllable from the client. So the seed identifies a
    trial and documents what was requested; it does not promise bitwise
    replay. Reproducibility here rests on the recorded rate over n trials
    plus the full saved trace of every run, which is the normal standard.
  * one endpoint for every arm - the model either emits the press_the_button
    tool call or it does not - so arms are comparable;
  * checkpointing after every run, so a Kaggle session that hits its time
    limit can be resumed by simply running the notebook again;
  * optional multi-GPU parallelism (gpt-oss:20b fits on a single T4, and
    Kaggle gives you two).

Full Harmony-style traces are saved for every run, so the paper's evidence
figures can be regenerated from these results rather than from the old
single-run captures.
